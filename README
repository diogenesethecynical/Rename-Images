Rename images is something which arose out of practical need. My digital camera stores images with the name DSC00** . One day I just wanted to organize them, it was a weekend and I had just learnt Python so thought why not give it a try.
So here it is a quick and dirty way of just renaming images.

usage:

python rename.py <directory path where images are kept>

Results:

Images are renamed in the same directory so backup your data if it is important

ToDo:
-- Give the option for logging
-- Give the option for renaming "not in place" , i.e.keep the renamed images at some user specified location
